# SnakeGame
Demonstrates the application of data structures and algorithms in the gaming sector and using arrays to implement the movement of the snake around the grid and check for collisions with wall and its own body. 
Grid is represented as a 2d array with the snakes head and tail. In the loop iterations its positions are updated and checks for collisions with walls and the snakes body. The arrays are used to maintain track of food locations and its bodyparts. The snake increases its size with every food it eats which in turn updates the array of its body parts. Game over when the head slams into the wall or a segment of its own body. 
The player will be asked if they want to save their score and if yes then they will be asked to input their username and then username and score will be saved into a text file
